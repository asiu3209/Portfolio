# Portfolio

## Overview

A personal portfolio website built with **TypeScript** and **React**, designed to
showcase skills, projects, and contact information. The site emphasizes a clean
UI, responsive design, and maintainable code structure that can add or update existing projects or information about myself.

## Problem Statement

Other than my github repo, there are no locations for me to publicly display all my projects and skills without a portfolio. This project is meant to display myself as a programmer and information about me currently. Deployment of this project will allow recruiters and companies on the internet to look up my website.

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: TypeScript and React
- **Styling**: Tailwind
